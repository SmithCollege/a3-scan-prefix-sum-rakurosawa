## Assignment 3 Reflection

### Did your graph match your runtime analysis expectations?
Somewhat.  For singleThdSS, my expectation was O(n) and that seems to hold true, however it is a bit difficult to tell because two of my data points produced the exact same run time and the third was different.  I think more tests would need to be conducted to determine a definiative result of if it is linear or not.  For naiveSS, I predicted O(n^2) and that definitely seems to hold true.  Lastly for recurseDbSS, I expected the runtime to be O(log(n)) as based off of the notes from class.  However, it seems to be following more of a linear path like that of singleThdSS.

### What went well with this assignment?
I think that the implementation of the cpu and naive codes went smoothly and well.  I think beyond that, everything else took a lot of effort and involved a lot of confusion, but thankfully everything ended up working out.

### What was difficult?
I did not understand what recursive doubling actually was which made the implementation of it difficult.  Once I understood the general idea, thigns went smoother though.  I also didn't really understand the timers either and struggled with implementation especially since I struggled to find the timer used on the slides (I eventually did).

### How would you approach differently?
If I were to do this again, I think I would start with the recursive doubling code and worry about the simpler ones later.  I think I spent too long trying to make the simple programs run "perfectly" leaving little time and lots of stress for completing recursive doubling.  

### Anything else you want me to know?
I don't think so.  I guess just thank you as always for helping me udnerstand as well as debugging my code.
